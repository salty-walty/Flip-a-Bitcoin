# Flip-a-Bitcoin
A simple dApp which provides provably fair Heads/Tails Bitcoin tosses using Chainlink's VRF.

This dApp aims to solve the number one problem with Bitcoin, that you cannot use a Bitcoin in a situaion that requires the toss of a coin. 
This dApp aslo aims to solve the number one problem with physical coins, that the odds are not really 50/50.

This dAapp will use Chainlink's VRF to create a proveably fair Bitcoin toss with even 50/50 odds!

For now, while in development (really it's mostly boiler at the moment) to see the dApp, from the app/ directory you run:

```npm run start```

As things really start to take shape, I'll update the readme! For now, I'm off to actually hack on this thing!
